# A Data Analysis Investigating Daily TikTok Content and Listening Habits
In this project, I'm using my TikTok liked video data and Spotify listened genre data simultaneously. By extracting the url of the TikTok videos that I liked, I'm going to reach the hashtags of the videos, then classify them under two contrasting categories using the words from the hashtags: negative content and positive content. At the same time, I'm going to get the genre of the music I've mostly listened to from Spotify on that specific day that I've liked those TikTok's. Basically the content of my datasets will include the URL's of the liked videos from TikTok (with specific date and time information) and most listened genre from Spotify (with specific date information). The main purpose of this project is to seek for a relation between the content I'm exposed from TikTok and the music type I choose to listen with the effect from those contents on my emotions. My main expectation is to have chosen more upbeat and hype sounds when I'm exposed to positive content and more slow and emotional sounds when I'm exposed to negative content. This data analysis could show the huge impact of social media and the content we consume on our daily mood and emotions.
